Spring 2018

## Required Files:
last_to_start.py and act.txt

## Output:
Prints possibilities and wrestlers to terminal.

## Summary:
This program will implement breadth first search using the input from a
text file.  The user will input a text file name at runtime and the program
will go through and use breadth first search to categorize each 
wrestler as a "baby face" or "heel".  Each wrestler is given
a pre-determined rivalry from the text file.  The program
will use BFS to check if this is possible or not.  All 
results will be outputted into the terminal.
Written in Python 3

## How to run:
Use the following command: python3 breadth_first_search.py to run the program.
Once the program is run, please input the txt file to use and include .txt in the input.
The program will ask the user for the file input at runtime.
The program will then run breadth first search on the text file data.

``` bash
$ python3 breadth_first_search.py
$ Enter Text File Name (include .txt): wrestlerN.txt
```
